# Faet: The DeFi Metaverse Engine

Faet is a decentralized game engine designed to empower developers to build immersive metaverse experiences leveraging blockchain technology. Built on Ethereumâ€™s Optimism Stack and compatible with EVM-based chains, Faet provides a scalable, low-cost, and secure environment for game development.

## Key Features
- **Layer 2 Optimism Integration**: High-speed, low-cost transactions with Optimistic Rollups.  
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Seamless asset transfers across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains.  
- **Modular Plugin Architecture**: Easily extend functionality using pre-built modules or custom integrations.  
- **NFT and Token Tools**: Mint and manage game assets as NFTs, with support for ERC-20 in-game currencies.  
- **RPG Maker MZ Support**: Start with the most popular indie game development tool, enabling rapid adoption of Web3 by low-code and junior developers.  

## Why Faet?
Modern game platforms are rejecting NFT-based games, leaving indie developers without blockchain-enabled options. Faet bridges this gap by creating a decentralized, creator-first ecosystem that fosters innovation, supports small teams, and provides easy-to-use tools for Web3 integration.

## Roadmap Highlights
- NFT and ERC-20 token support.  
- Multiplayer functionality and in-game NFT trading.  
- Cross-chain compatibility and decentralized governance.  
- AI-powered tools for generative game assets.
